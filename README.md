# shinyFMBN: Explore and Visualize Food Bacterial Communities

#### Use app online: __[www.shinyappstore.com/a/shinyFMBN](https://shinyappstore.com/a/shinyFMBN)__

ShinyFMBN is an application providing simplified access to the FoodMicrobionet database, facilitating the exploration of food studies and samples. It allows users to search, select, and visualize data, as well as create graphs. The FoodMicrobionet database focuses on the bacterial microbiota of food, obtained through high-throughput sequencing. With 180 studies and 10,151 samples spanning eight major food groups, FoodMicrobionet stands out as one of the most extensive and well-annotated databases on bacterial communities in food. The application, based on this database, offers features such as sample extraction, group filtering, aggregation of samples or taxa, and comprehensive visualization and analysis capabilities.
